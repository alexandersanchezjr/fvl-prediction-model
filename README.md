## Appointment No-Show Prediction with Python

This project utilizes Python libraries to develop a machine learning model for predicting patient no-shows in appointments. 

### Project Goal

The goal is to build a model that can analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of a patient not showing up for a scheduled appointment. This can help healthcare providers:

* Improve appointment scheduling efficiency.
* Reduce wasted resources due to no-shows.
* Proactively contact patients at high risk of no-shows with appointment reminders.


### Technical Stack

* Python (>= 3.7)
* Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost)
* Data manipulation libraries (e.g., pandas)
* Data visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/alexandersanchezjr/fvl-prediction-model.git](https://github.com/alexandersanchezjr/fvl-prediction-model.git)
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Explore the data:**

Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to explore the appointment data and perform initial analysis.

4. **Train the model:**

Run the scripts in the `src` folder to clean the data, extract features, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
